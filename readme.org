#+TITLE: Potential method to implement

** Random Sampling

*** TODO Softmax regression

- [ ] Sampling with replacement
- [ ] Poisson sampling
- [ ] A, L, minimum prediction error
- [ ] LUC

*** TODO Logistic regression

I think [[https://github.com/Ossifragus/OSMAC][this version]] is outdated; not sure if anything is useful to you.

- [ ] Sampling with replacement
- [ ] Poisson sampling
- [ ] A, L, LCC, unweighted estimator with bias correction
- [ ] [[https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.13048.pdf][optimal sampling for rare events]]; [[file:references/RareLogistic/][julia code]]. The method can be
  implemented using logistic regression with the log-odds corrections as a
  off-set variable. I put the julia code so that you have it.

*** TODO GLM

You can use existing packages for fitting, right?

- [ ] Sampling with replacement
- [ ] Poisson sampling
- [ ] A, L 
- [ ] [[https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10618600.2020.1778483][OSUMC]]
	- weighted estimator
	- [[file:references/OSUMC/OSUMC_unweighted.pdf][unweighted estimator]]: This method can be fitted with glm in R directly. The
    code is in Python; I put it the so that you have it. For this method, the
    sampling probabilities are very similar to OSMAC. 
		
*** TODO [[https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.10168.pdf][Quantile regression]]

Codes are available [[https://filedn.com/l3ajGDP3gyLyPFvbUFtvg48/code/][here]]. It is written in julia, but the quantile regression is
done by calling the R package.

- [ ] Sampling with replacement
- [ ] L with iterative sampling

*** IDEA Other methods to consider
These methods can be considered later if you are too busy.

**** Mixture models
Let me know if the LaTeX source is useful to you.

[[file:references/Mixture/jds.pdf][paper]]; [[https://github.com/pedigree07/OPTMixture][code]]


**** Weibull regression
Let me know if the LaTeX source is useful to you. The title is general
parametric aft, but the code are only about Weibull regression. 

[[file:references/weibull/main.pdf][paper]]; [[https://github.com/YEnthalpy/osmac-parametric-aft-models][code]]


** Deterministic selection (consider later?) 

Methods in this category may not perform well with real data. Including them in
the package may be for the purpose of citations. High citations will be
beneficial to you for both academia and industry. 

*** [[https://ossifragus.github.io/pdfs/IBOSS_Linear.pdf][IBOSS Linear]]

[[https://github.com/Ossifragus/IBOSS][This version]] is outdated, I think. [[https://filedn.com/l3ajGDP3gyLyPFvbUFtvg48/code/IBOSS/][Here]] are more codes; the one with Rcpp may be
easier for you.

Here are the divide and conquer version [[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.09948.pdf][paper]] and [[https://filedn.com/l3ajGDP3gyLyPFvbUFtvg48/code/IBOSS-DC-Linear/][code]].

[[file:references/Centering][Here]] are the draft and code for the centering trick to consider if you implement
methods in this category.  

*** IBOSS logistic

[[https://ossifragus.github.io/pdfs/IBOSS_Logistic.pdf][paper]]; [[file:references/IBOSS_Logistic/code][code]]

*** Sequential online thinning

[[https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.00792.pdf][paper]]; [[file:references/Luc/numeric][julia code]], these are not the code used in the paper (my collaborator used
MatLab for the paper).
