#+TITLE: Potential method to implement

* Random Sampling

** TODO Softmax regression

- [ ] Sampling with replacement
- [ ] Poisson sampling
- [ ] A, L, minimum prediction error
- [ ] LUC

** TODO Logistic regression

- [ ] Sampling with replacement
- [ ] Poisson sampling
- [X] A, L, LCC, unweighted estimator with bias correction

** TODO GLM

You can use existing packages for fitting, right?

- [ ] Sampling with replacement
- [ ] Poisson sampling
- [ ] A, L 
- [ ] [[https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10618600.2020.1778483][OSUMC]]
	- weighted estimator
	- [[file:references/OSUMC_unweighted.pdf][unweighted estimator]]: This method can be fitted with glm in R directly.

** TODO Quantile regression

- [ ] Sampling with replacement
- [ ] L with iterative sampling
