#+TITLE: Potential method to implement

* Random Sampling

** TODO Softmax regression

- [ ] Sampling with replacement
- [ ] Poisson sampling
- [ ] A, L, minimum prediction error
- [ ] LUC

** TODO Logistic regression

- [ ] Sampling with replacement
- [ ] Poisson sampling
- [X] A, L, LCC, unweighted estimator with bias correction

** TODO GLM

You can use existing packages for fitting, right?

- [ ] Sampling with replacement
- [ ] Poisson sampling
- [ ] A, L 
- [ ] OSUMC
	- weighted estimator
	- unweighted estimator

** TODO Quantile regression

- [ ] Sampling with replacement
- [ ] L with iterative sampling
